### Details Pages
  - When we select a subscription, we can see the title, poster image and the concise summary of each sequel in the series. This summary has been generated by OpenAI API, specifically model gpt-3.5-turbo.
  - We will also show a list of main characters of the subscription series. For each selected character, our application will call the OpenAI API to generate descriptions about the character relationships between the selected character and all remaining characters being shown.
